# Flowers-classification

Distributed training a CNN(ViT in future) to classify 104 kinds of flower pictures.

Strategy:
* Define a distribution training strategy for eight computing instances.
* Defining stochastic image augmentation strategies.
* Statistical image data to set hyperparameters.
* Create a data pipeline.
* Build and fit a model for prediction.
* Use data augmentation to evaluate models(Test Time Augmentation).

Result:
* The accuracy is **97%**.
* Outperformed 99.91% of competitors.
